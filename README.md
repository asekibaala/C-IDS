C-IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
Author: Abel Sekibaala

C-IDS is a lightweight Intrusion Detection System implemented in C programming language. It aims to monitor network traffic, analyze packets, and detect potential intrusions or suspicious activities. The IDS incorporates various modules for packet capture, packet analysis, rule engine, alert generation, logging, response mechanism, configuration, and management.

Functionality
The C-IDS repository includes the following key functionalities:

Packet Capture: Captures network packets using raw sockets to monitor network traffic.

Packet Analysis: Analyzes captured packets, extracting relevant information for further processing.

Rule Engine: Implements a rule engine to match packet information against predefined rules or signatures.

Alert Generation: Generates alerts when a packet matches a rule, providing details of the detected intrusion or suspicious activity.

Logging: Maintains a log file to record captured packets, alerts, and other relevant information for further analysis and auditing.

Response Mechanism: Optionally includes a response mechanism to counteract detected threats, such as blocking IP addresses or terminating connections.

Configuration and Management: Provides interfaces for configuration and management, allowing customization of rules, alert thresholds, network segments to monitor, and other system settings.

Continuous Monitoring: Operates in real-time, continuously monitoring network traffic and analyzing packets as they arrive.

Usage
To use the C-IDS, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/C-IDS.git
